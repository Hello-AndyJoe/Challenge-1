# Challenge 01 - Semantic Code Refactor


## Description


The source HTML and CSS code of the Horiseon Social Solution Services webpage was reviewed and simplified with the use of semantic HTML tags and the reduction of redundant CSS code. This will benefit the webpage by making it more accessible to users utilizing screen readers and other related accessibility technologies. Additionally, the removal of redundant CSS code will make it efficient for browsers to render and to easier add/edit the styling of the page in the future.


## Installation


There is no Installation involved on the users side to utilize this webpage; just visit [https://hello-andyjoe.github.io/Challenge-1/](https://hello-andyjoe.github.io/Challenge-1/)


## Usage

From the user perspective, there's no additional usage beyond just reviewing the copy on the site.

When inspecting the code, it can be observed in the HTML code the use of semantic code in favor of div elements with class attributes. The replacing of div elements with class attributes also meant that CSS code could be combined in several instances.

The example shown below is three snippets of CSS code that are identical in purpose being combined into one snippet with the use of a semantic HTML element.
